Instructions

In order to run the program tests must be set up as 2 dimensional arrays of sliding puzzles. Use the number
'0' to indicate the empty tile. Then use the problem class from 'SlidingPuzzle.py' to create a problem. By
passing the problem to the 'runTest' function we can test the results of solving the problem with either
approach.

Currently the algorithm is working but we are missing test cases to compare and contrast initial states
that favor either approach to the problem. The ones we do have prove that A* works.
